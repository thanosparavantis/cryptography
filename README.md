# Cryptography

Algorithms in Python 3 that demonstrate popular cryptography techniques.

## Caesar Cypher

The Caesar Cypher is located in the `caesar.py` python file.

In order to use it, you must choose a numerical number ranging from 0 to 25.
With the `CaesarCypher` class you can encrypt, decrypt or bruteforce a message.
Do keep in mind that all string inputs must be lowercase.

## Vigenere Cypher

The Vigenere Cypher is located in the `vigenere.py` python file.

Before using it, you must choose a preferably large string as your key.
You can utilize the `VigenereCypher` class to encrypt and decrypt messages.
Do keep in mind that all string inputs must be lowercase.
